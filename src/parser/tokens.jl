A token `τ::Token` denotes a part of the source string indicating a region that may need further
processing. It is identified by a symbol `τ.name` (e.g.: `:MATH_ALIGN_OPEN`). Tokens are typically
used in this code to identify delimiters of environments. For instance, `abc \$ ... \$ def`
contains two tokens `:MATH_A` associated with the `\$` sign. Together they delimit here an inline
math expression.

Forward lookup checking if a sequence of characters matches `refstring` and is followed (or not
followed if `isfollowed==false`) by a character out of a list of characters (`follow`).
It returns

1. a number of steps indicating the number of characters to check,
2. whether there is an offset or not (if it is required to check a following character or not),
3. a function that can be applied on a sequence of character.
