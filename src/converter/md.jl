Convert a judoc markdown file read as `mds` into a judoc html string. Returns the html string as
well as a dictionary of page variables.

**Arguments**

* `mds`:         the markdown string to process
* `pre_lxdefs`:  a vector of `LxDef` that are already available.

**Keyword arguments**

* `isrecursive=false`: a bool indicating whether the call is the parent call or a child call
* `isconfig=false`:    a bool indicating whether the file to convert is the configuration file
* `has_mddefs=true`:   a bool indicating whether to look for definitions of page variables
